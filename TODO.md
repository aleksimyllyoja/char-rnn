## For now

* [ ] Model's evaluation

* [ ] LSTM tuning options

* [ ] Voice generation (encoded `char-level`)

* [ ] Not just about character-level model -> `word-level` like PTB

* [ ] **Further Reading** of http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness#further-reading


## Future

* [ ] More RNN shell engine (i.e. `GRU`) -> Option for select shell
